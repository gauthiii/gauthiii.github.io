            <br>
            "The Unfinished Plot - Volume 1" is a novel by Gautham Vijayaraj, focusing on a ghostwriter known as "The Subject." The story delves into the ghostwriter's life, working in a small Chennai office, fixing unfinished scripts for various clients. 
            A significant event occurs when an enigmatic man named Vinay Narendar commissions the ghostwriter to create an original prison break story. This story, however, comes with a twist: the protagonist is unaware he is in prison. 
            The narrative then shifts to the ghostwriter's process of developing this challenging concept, grappling with the complexities of creating a story where the main character's freedom is an illusion.

        <strong style="font-size: 15px;">Detailed Plot</strong>
<br>
The narrator identifies himself only as "The Subject," a ghostwriter. 
He begins by questioning the audience's perception of filmmaking, particularly when a director who has previously produced mediocre work suddenly creates a masterpiece. 
He suggests that this sudden leap in quality might not solely be the director's doing, hinting at the hidden contributions of others, like himself. 
The Subject then reveals his profession: ghostwriting. 
He clarifies that he doesn't receive public recognition or accolades for his work. 
Instead, he receives payment, which he sometimes finds sufficient. 
He emphasizes his anonymity and the lack of importance attached to his personal identity in his line of work. 
His clients are the ones who get the credit, while he remains behind the scenes.
He describes his office, a small, cramped space in Chennai, filled with the signs of his trade: peeling paint, a noisy fan, a cluttered desk buried under manuscripts, and the lingering smell of stale coffee and ink. 
This office, named "Unsung Scripters," is where forgotten stories are brought to life. 
He portrays his role as a fixer, a person who takes half-finished or flawed stories and transforms them into something complete and coherent. 
The Subject finds a certain thrill in his invisibility, in being able to shape narratives without being tied to them personally. 
He appreciates the freedom to walk away from a project once it's done, with no lingering attachments or expectations. 
He highlights the convenience of not having to start from scratch, as his clients provide the initial ideas and drafts. 
He sees himself as someone who polishes and completes what others have begun, correcting grammar, refining plot twists, and ultimately making the stories better.

<br><br>
The first chapter begins with the Subject, scrolling through Wikipedia late at night in his office, Unsung Scripters. 
His quiet evening is interrupted by an unexpected visitor, a man with an air of arrogance. 
The man inquires about the Subject's work on a recent film and reveals he needs a story, specifically a prison break. 
He provides a manila folder filled with notes and ideas, but the Subject is hesitant to take the job, especially since another prison movie is releasing soon. 
The man insists, and after some discussion, the Subject agrees with conditions, including rewriting everything and tripling his rate. 
The man reveals his name, Vinay Narendar, and adds a crucial twist to the story: the protagonist is in prison but doesn't know it.
The next day, he meets Vinay Narendar at his office to finalize their agreement. 
They discuss the unusual prison break story, with the protagonist unaware of his imprisonment, and the challenges it presents. 
The Subject agrees to the task, and returns to his office to begin writing. 
He struggles with the unique concept, questioning the nature of freedom and imprisonment. 
Later, Kruthik, his office assistant, seeks help with a short film script. 
The Subject critiques Kruthik's disastrous script and proceeds to teach him the fundamentals of screenwriting, emphasizing format, structure, and character development. 
He stresses the importance of setting, time period, and layering to create a compelling story, using examples and exercises to guide Kruthik.

<br><br>
The Subject struggles to make progress on Vinay Narendar's complex prison break story. 
He grapples with the concept of a protagonist who doesn't know he's imprisoned, leading to frustration and discarded drafts. 
He reflects on the challenges of balancing creativity with client expectations, feeling the pressure of producing something groundbreaking. 
Amidst these struggles, the Subject continues to ponder Vinay's unusual story, realizing the need to redefine the idea of imprisonment itself to make the narrative work. 
Then comes the unexpected arrival of Sidharth Raghuvaran, a former friend and business partner whom the Subject despises, throwing his concentration off course.
Sidharth visits the Subject offering to help with his complex prison break script, suggesting talking to their former colleague Arjun, who lives in a deluded reality. 
The Subject initially refuses, harboring deep resentment from their past business partnership. 
He recounts how Sidharth and Arjun dismissed and erased their intern Ravi's contribution to a major film project, prioritizing profit over ethics. 
This led Ravi to suicide and the Subject to leave the company. 
Kruthik, after hearing this story, is shocked and advises the Subject to use Sidharth's offer to his advantage, to "catch him by his balls," suggesting the Subject should exploit the situation to benefit his own script and career.
The Subject meets Sidharth at a dimly lit bar. 
The atmosphere is tense with their history. 
Sidharth offers the Subject a Kingfisher Lager, a reminder of their old times. 
The Subject immediately gets to the point, asking about Arjun and how he ended up in his current situation. 
Sidharth reveals that Arjun was always obsessed with control, not just in stories but in life. 
He then explains that after the Subject left their company, Arjun delved deeper into the industry, working on projects that involved controlling perception for powerful clients. 
Sidharth mentions Arjun worked on a government contract involving behavioral conditioning, but he eventually lost his grip on reality and was institutionalized. 
He tells the Subject Arjun believes he is a character in someone else's narrative. 
After the Subject leaves, he encounters a girl who was lost, but he brushes it off, showing her the directions.

<br><br>
After a long day with Sidharth, the Subject returns to his office where Kruthik is waiting. 
He recounts the bizarre events. Later, a girl he'd encountered earlier asking for directions appears at his office, identifying herself as Ananya Shankar. 
She reveals she needs a ghostwriter for her screenplay but refuses to divulge the story unless she's sure he's the right person. 
Intrigued, the Subject engages her, and they discuss their writing styles and motivations. 
There's a clear spark between them, filled with playful banter and mutual curiosity. 
Ananya is sharp and challenges the Subject's ego, which he finds surprisingly appealing. 
She suggests they meet for dinner the next day at Ministry of Drinks to discuss further, implying it's not just a formal interview. 
The Subject is flustered but agrees, sensing this encounter is more than just a potential client meeting.

<br><br>
The next day, after successfully sneaking into the Madhavaram facility, the Subject and Sidharth find Arjun in a secluded room. 
Arjun appears disheveled but strangely composed. 
He claims to be the one running the facility and orchestrating major national events. 
He speaks of "writing scenarios" for the country, manipulating public perception, and having a team that executes his "scripts." 
He mentions an upcoming economic crisis, fuel price hikes, and a staged "savior" emerging, all as part of a planned narrative.
Arjun's unsettling calmness and conviction creep both the Subject and Sidharth out. He talks about "testing" events with focus groups and simulations, claiming they write multiple versions of reality before executing the desired one. 
His delusion is so deeply ingrained that he believes he's in control, despite clearly being confined. Sidharth tries to reason with him, but Arjun dismisses their concerns, insisting he's "needed" and that he's the "writer" of the world's script.
The Subject and Sidharth realize they can't reach Arjun or change his mind. His words are too disturbing, and the implications of his claims are terrifying. They understand that they've stumbled into something far bigger and more dangerous than they anticipated. 
Fearing for their safety and realizing they can't help Arjun in his current state, they decide to leave immediately.
Back at Sidharth's house, they're both shaken. Sidharth, who has a background in data analysis, decides to use his skills to try and track the organization Arjun mentioned. 
He runs an algorithm designed to identify patterns in recent events, looking for anomalies and potential connections to Arjun's claims. 

<br><br>
Sidharth explains that the algorithm he's running to track the organization's potential next move will take about a day to complete. 
Impatient and anxious, the Subject later encounters Vinay Narendar. 
He decides to test the waters, subtly recounting Arjun's claims as if they were a fictional script idea. 
He describes characters manipulating events, staging crises, and controlling narratives from behind the scenes, all while being trapped in a facility. 
The Subject frames it as needing a "team" for his story, to which Vinay responds thoughtfully, suggesting the protagonist would require an "Infiltrator," a "Protector," and a "Handler" to keep him grounded in reality. 
This confirms the Subject's suspicion that Vinay might know more than he lets on.

<br><br>
Later that evening, the Subject meets Ananya Shankar for dinner. 
He's nervous but tries to play it cool. 
Ananya is captivating, and the dinner turns into a lively exchange of banter, shared stories, and surprisingly deep conversation. 
They discuss films, personal philosophies, and even a game of chugging beer, where Ananya proves to be unexpectedly competitive. 
The Subject finds himself drawn to her sharp wit and genuine interest. 
They share an easy chemistry, and the evening flies by. Ananya eventually reveals that her script is deeply personal and that she needs to trust the person who works on it. 
The dinner ends on a warm note, with both acknowledging the connection between them. The Subject leaves feeling a mix of excitement and vulnerability, realizing he's not just interested in her script, but in her as well. 
He feels like he has finally met someone who understands him. He feels like he is winning this game.

<br><br>
The Subject reconnects with Sidharth, who reveals the results of his financial algorithm. 
Sidharth explains Project Niyantran is a covert organization manipulating events behind the scenes, led by a mysterious figure known only as "The Creator." 
They control politics, economics, and media narratives, orchestrating crises and shaping history. 
The algorithm has triangulated a couple of locations associated with Niyantran's financial transactions, potential hideouts or fronts for their operations.
Realizing the magnitude of the situation and the need for a team, the Subject recruits his roommate and best friend, Raghav, who is a graphic designer. 
He also enlists Raghav's girlfriend, Aisha, an architect whose expertise in building structures will be crucial for infiltrating any facility where Arjun might be held. 
Aisha is initially hesitant but agrees after understanding the bigger picture.
Furthermore, the Subject reaches out to an old college friend, Rishi, now an MMA coach. 
Rishi, known for his hot-headedness and rejection from the IPS selection due to his rage issues, possesses the combat skills they desperately need. 
Rishi agrees to join, motivated by the potential for payment and a deeper desire to channel his aggression into something meaningful.
Rishi begins rigorous combat training with the Subject, Sidharth Raghav, and Aisha. 
He emphasizes not just fighting, but strategy, situational awareness, and how to incapacitate and disarm opponents quickly. 
He also stresses the importance of patching themselves up and handling weapons. 
The training sessions are intense, pushing everyone to their limits and highlighting their lack of experience, but gradually, they begin to learn and adapt, preparing for the dangerous mission ahead.

<br><br>
The team realizes Niyantran will likely move Arjun during a large-scale, orchestrated event to mask the transfer. 
Aisha identifies the Tondiarpet abandoned dockyard as the most probable site, but also the most challenging for extraction due to its layout and security. 
They deduce Niyantran plans to trigger an economic recession by manipulating fuel prices, creating chaos and distraction. 
The Subject, stressed and famished, meets Vinay Narendar for a much-needed break. During their conversation, Vinay reveals his deep personal connection to the prison break idea. 
He shares that his father was wrongfully accused and died in prison, fueling his obsession with stories of escape and justice. 
Vinay expresses his unwavering belief in the Subject's ability to successfully write the script and, by extension, help him fulfill his personal quest for vindication, seeing it as a way to rewrite his own story. 
He trusts that the Subject can pull this off.

<br><br>
The Subject decides to take a day off but ends up trying to renovate the office with Kruthik. 
Their attempts are chaotic and unsuccessful. 
Ananya arrives to help, bringing order and design sense. 
As they work, a moment arises between the Subject and Ananya, leading to their first kiss. 
The air is charged, and there's a clear connection. Ananya then reveals she's now more inclined to share her script with him but not today, leaving him eager and anticipating their next meeting. 
She exits, leaving the Subject both thrilled and slightly dazed.

<br><br>
When the Subject leaves for home, he's abruptly attacked by an unknown figure dressed in a black robe, wearing a LED mask marked with a 20-sided polygon logo. 
Sidharth arrives just in time, and together, they fend off the attacker. 
Before fleeing, the mysterious man identifies himself as a "Fixer" and blinds them momentarily with a rectangular device. 
Soon after, the Subject realizes this wasn't an isolated incident-all their team members faced similar attacks. 
The entire team meets to discuss these events, and tension escalates as Raghav and Aisha argue heatedly, deciding eventually to take some space apart.
Realizing that their operation is compromised, the group acknowledges that Niyantran is onto them, compelling them to accelerate their timeline. 
They intensify their training regime, doubling down on rehearsals, shooting practice, and meticulous planning. 
Over a couple of challenging months, their preparation culminates in a refined strategy outlining every step of their rescue mission for Arjun, along with a comprehensive approach to control the ensuing narrative. 
They plan to expose Niyantran's actions publicly to shift perception in their favor. Now, with just two days remaining until the critical moment, the team feels the immense pressure of their impending mission. 
Every detail is set, anticipation is at its peak, and the stakes have never been higher.

<br><br>
The team takes 2 days to clear their mind and the Subject briefly takes a break to clear his mind, a fleeting moment of calm for a chaotic day. 
However, that peace is abruptly shattered when he discovers that Kruthik has crossed a crucial ethical line, prompting him to vent his anger and decisively send Kruthik away.
And then to make things worse, the Subject confronts an unsettling revelation when he reads Ananya's script: a narrative that mirrors his own life with eerie precision. 
Believing she has been exploiting his personal experiences to craft a story based on his experiments with his emotions, he loses his temper and sends her home in a fit of anger. 
Later, upon returning home, he is haunted by inexplicable memories of events that never occurred, triggering a sense of paranoia. 
Overwhelmed by the disturbing blend of reality and fiction, he succumbs to despair, drinking heavily until he passes out for two days.

<br><br>
The Subject awakens with a brutal hangover after blacking out for over a day. 
His physical state mirrors the chaos in his mind, a pounding headache, dry throat, and a body stiffened by regret after a heavy night of whiskey. 
Realizing he's lost crucial time on the final day of recon, he scrambles to regain control. He methodically rehydrates, reorients himself, and forces his focus on the mission. 
As he reviews a live digital heat map of the dockyard with his team, tension mounts. 
They discuss entry points, guard placements, and the extraction timeline for Arjun. 
Despite lingering doubts and personal regrets, reminders of his past and a painful longing for Ananya, the team's determination to execute the operation remains unshaken. 
Their positions are meticulously assigned within a 10km radius, and every second counts as they brace for what lies ahead.
The operation spirals into explosive action. At the extraction point near a rusted shipping container, Rishi, clad in a forced docker uniform and hockey mask, bemoans the discomfort of their attire while preparing to carry a crate packed with essential armaments. 
The calm of the pre-extraction stage is abruptly shattered when Sidharth alerts the team: security has uncovered two fake docker IDs. Moments later, the dockyard's lights flicker violently and power surges before failing, a signal that the enemy has tightened its grip. 
The comms crackle with frantic orders as armed guards and Fixers converge on the extraction point. With the planned route compromised, the team scrambles into a chaotic, high-stakes dash through the facility's labyrinthine alleys, determined to secure Arjun and survive the mounting onslaught.

<br><br>
The team launches a high-octane mission to extract Arjun, launching into a Mission Impossible-esque shootout. 
As bullets fly and chaos ensues, victory seems within reach when suddenly the Creator appears. 
Shock ripples through the team as they recognize the uncanny resemblance the Creator bears to each of them. 
Sidharth then reveals that the mysterious, flashy device—using refractive technology—has been masking the Creator's true identity. 
Amid the ensuing messy fight, the team splits into two groups. Raghav, Rishi, and Aisha push forward to rescue Arjun; when Raghav is nearly killed, Aisha intervenes heroically, and they reconcile. 
They slip through the exit passage, anxiously awaiting the Subject and Sidharth. Meanwhile, the Subject and Sidharth nearly overpower the Creator. However, just as they're about to destroy the server farm intended to trigger an economic crisis, Sidharth shocks everyone by revealing he has been allied with the Creator all along.
In a stunning twist, the Creator reveals that everything was a ruse to lure the Subject into joining Niyantran. 
According to the Creator, the Subject is essential for designing narratives and adding the crucial emotional layer their grand plan needs—something Arjun was incapable of providing. 
When the Subject questions the rationale, the Creator explains that this emotional infusion is necessary to construct a new world free of chaos and evil. 
The Subject flatly rejects the proposal, triggering the Creator to order the elimination of his teammates. 
At that moment, the Subject executes his own double-cross, having suspected Sidharth's betrayal all along. 
He activates his backup plan: Vinay and Kruthik, along with Vinay's resources, rush in to save the endangered team members. 
Together, they storm the facility and successfully dismantle the server farm that was poised to trigger an economic crisis. 
However, as they prepare to escape, the Creator viciously kills the Subject right before his eyes. In a fit of revenge, the Subject lunges at the Creator, but the latter coldly recounts the losses he's endured—friends like Kruthik, Ravi, and even Ananya. 
The final, shattering revelation comes when the Creator exposes that the events involving Ananya never actually occurred in the present, as she has been dead all along.

<br><br>
And then, they show what exactly happened after that fight with Ananya.
After the violent confrontation with Ananya, the Subject is gripped by paranoia over the fight. 
The following day, Ananya returns and pleads for his trust, insisting that her life has nothing to do with the script mirroring his own. 
In a moment of vulnerability, they reconcile and make love. 
Later that night, the Subject receives a late call from Ananya. 
Confused, he answers only to discover that the voice belongs to the real Ananya. He is actually with an imposter posing as the real Ananya, who then launches a deadly attack on him. 
In a desperate bid for survival, the Subject narrowly escapes the ambush. Soon after, the real Ananya arrives, and together they engage in a self-defense struggle, ultimately killing the imposter. 
As the Subject examines the imposter's chest scar and birthmark, a chilling realization dawns on him, something is terribly wrong. 
He is overcome with the unsettling feeling that he has already been dead before.

<br><br>
At the present moment, the Creator reveals a shocking proposition: the Subject could regain everyone he lost if he joins Niyantran. 
The Creator explains that his grand plan is to harness the Subject's unique narrative prowess to engineer an ideal, AI-driven simulation, a world free from the perils and chaos that plague humanity. 
In this simulated reality, death is merely an illusion; when someone dies, only their memories are reset, allowing the Subject to be reunited with his lost loved ones. 
The Subject reacts with disbelief and anger, questioning why he should ever join such a cause. 
The Creator calmly insists that the simulation will eradicate all threats, creating a utopia where every loss can be undone. 
Furthermore, it is shockingly revealed that the earlier events involving Ananya and the Subject were not part of his actual life but occurred solely within the simulation. 
In the real world, events continued in a strict chronological order, whereas the simulated encounters with Ananya which was created sometime in the future and somehow the Subject actually joined Niyantran.
And this story ends right here with a cliffhanger.
